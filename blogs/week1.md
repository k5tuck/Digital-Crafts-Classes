# Week 1

## Python Basics Covered
1. print()
2. variables
3. types
5. comparisons

## Explanation
### Print() Function
This week so far we have gone over the basics of beginning basics of python. To recap a little:
* The print function can be very helpful in debugging and will display content in the output terminal

```Python
print("This is a great way to debug")
#This will print out "This is a great way to debug"
```
### Variables
Variable are names that you can assign different types too. Example:
```Python
first_var = "Random Name" # Here the String "Random Name" is assigned to first_var
first_int = 38 # Here the integer 38 is assigned to the variable first_int
last_float = 69.123 # A float has been assigned to the variable last_float
```

### Types
* There a different *types* in Python
    * Strings
    * Integers
    * Floats
    * Booleans

#### Strings
String can be de defined by the following:
```Python
string1 = 'This is a string'
string2 = "This is also a string"
string3 = 'Ya\'ll this will also be a string too'
string4 = '''
This will become a block of strings. 
This can become useful for long strings of text 
that are too long for a single line.
'''
```
#### Numbers - Integers / Floats

Integers and Floats can differ.

Integers can be considered whole numbers, either positive or negative.
Example: 
```
a = 1
b = 1003
c = -390
```

Floats can be considered decimals. They are similar to doubles and floats in C++.
Example:
```
a = 3.9
b = -1.9404
c = 8274.928794
```

#### Booleans
Booleans are either True or False values.

```Python
0 = False
1 = True
"a" == "a" # Evaluates to True
40 >= "a" # Evaluates to False
```

### Comparisons

```Python
1 == 1 # The == operator compares whether these two numbers equal each other or not
1 >= 2 # The >= compares 
1 <= 2
1 > 2
1 < 2 
```
